# Public_Opinion_Robot

This is a script that will give you the sentiment (good or bad) of a topic using Google News, Google Trends and Twitter. The module that
will tell us the sentiment is called TextBlob and is the core of the functionality of the program.

NOTE: You will need a Google Mail account (user and password) and a Twitter account with developer API enabled (consumer key, consumer
secret, access token and access token secret).
